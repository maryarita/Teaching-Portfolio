In this lesson, after engaging with three texts by authors of color who speak about their names and identities, students reflect on their own names. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HIJYy9odyVw2Yqpi6BcxW0d1rSefMzWTrKr3rQS-Ips/edit?slide=id.g318887dc8ca_0_29#slide=id.g318887dc8ca_0_29">slides</a> include opportunities for students to journal about their names, including language of origin and the story behind how they were named. Their final assignment allows them to build on this self-reflection by creating their own text that tells a story about them and their relationship to their name. This lesson, designed for an eighth-grade class, prompts age-appropriate reflection and allows them to connect something deeply relevant (their names) to issues of race, language, and power.</p>

In a discussion with their peers, students will deepen their understanding of why writers vary their sentence structure and how sentence structure differs across languages. I invite students to reflect on how they structure sentences in the languages they speak, and in sharing, students learn from one another the many ways that sentences can sound. This is done through a series of activities, starting with surface opinions about which sentence looks "better," followed by analyzing sentences for their subjects, verbs, and objects, discussing varied sentence structures in students' home languages, and finishing with a collaborative peer review process that invites students to offer compliments and constructive criticism focused on syntax. As students collaborate to compliment one another and offer each other feedback on their poem drafts, they will feel the payoff of their effort in writing their poem and will feel supported in the revision process.</p>

I model linguistic pluralism in this lesson by using both Greek and English on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HIJYy9odyVw2Yqpi6BcxW0d1rSefMzWTrKr3rQS-Ips/edit?slide=id.g124174b6915_1_53#slide=id.g124174b6915_1_53">slide</a> about my name, and "Names/Nombres" by Julia Alvarez includes both Spanish and English. The lesson addresses the bias toward English and "American-sounding" names in the United States and teaches students to be proud of their names and the multiple languages they speak.</p>

One student also brought up <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, a text many students read in their junior English classes, showing a deepening understanding of the concepts and an ability to make connections between current and prior learning.</p>

                    I wrote for my English Methods course, I help students students form concrete revision goals for their poem drafts by grounding 
                    them in sentence structure. Instead of just telling them to "vary their sentence structure," we come to understand <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> 
                    writers vary sentence structure. After a collaborative peer review process that invites students to offer compliments and constructive 
                    criticism focused on syntax, students will have the remainder of class time to put their revisions into action. They receive 
                    feedback from their peers that helps them understand the progress they are making toward their final goal, and they complete 
                    an exit slip that allows for self-reflection: “How will you use your peers' feedback and today's class to revise your poem?” 
                    This prompt will help them set goals for their revision process. In addition, they will have a <b>Revision Checklist</b> to help them monitor their progress and help them focus their areas of improvement and strength throughout their revision process.</p>
